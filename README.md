# NEW-CHIP-DMA-ATTACK
NEW DMA ATTACK

New DMA attack device, has been in 2021 PCILeech open source the first DMA device attack scheme, in a long time in a stable form, there have been many game detection companies for this open source project for targeted technical research, at present they will be a specific space for a particular hardware to carry out the detection, and the simulation of the hardware is just some surface work they Will not pass your hardware real degree to detect this hardware is legitimate, due to the love of electronic hardware, we found a lot of hardware based on the DMA kernel to complete the DMA kernel work method, I work through the principle of the graphics card, to produce a new type of hardware attack programme, but I have not open source, he can work on many games, at the same time, I've been in the social media platform to share and give away several platform to share and give away a few customers to test, their feedback are very good, if you also want to support this project you can follow and join my DISCORD!
